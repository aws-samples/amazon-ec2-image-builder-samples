Description: >
  This sample template creates AWS CloudFormation resources for an EC2 ImageBuilder pipeline that builds an Windows 2019 container image to host
  a .NET web application, and publishes the image to the an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository. The pipeline, by default, is
  scheduled to run a build at 10:00AM Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) every day. The build will only run if dependent resources have been updated.

Parameters:
  CustomSubnetId:
    Type: String
    Default: ""
    Description: If you do not have a default VPC, or want to use a different VPC, specify the ID of a subnet in which to place the instance used to customize your EC2 container image. If not specified, a subnet from your default VPC will be used.

  CustomSecurityGroupId:
    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Default: ""
    Description: Required if you specified a custom subnet ID. Comma-delimited list of one or more IDs of security groups belonging to the VPC to associate with the instance used to customize your EC2 container image.

  BuildInstanceType:
    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Default: 'c5.xlarge'
    Description: Comma-delimited list of one or more instance types to select from when building the image. Image Builder will select a type based on availability. The supplied default is compatible with the AWS Free Tier.

  TargetECRRepository:
    Description: Name of the target ECR repository to push container image to
    Type: String
    Default: windows-webapp

  ImageTag:
    Description: Tag for the output docker image.
    Type: String
    Default: latest

  ResourceName:
    Type: String
    Default: windows-webapp
    Description: A name to use for all Image Builder resources

  ResourceVersion:
    Type: String
    Default: '1.0.0'
    Description: The version to use for Image Builder resources

  DotnetSourceZipFile:
    Type: String
    Default: https://github.com/genericinternetcompany/windows-webapp/releases/download/1.0.0/windows-webapp.zip
    Description: An S3 URI to a zip file containing a .NET web application. The web application must have been published for the `win-x64` runtime. For example, `dotnet publish --configuration release --runtime win-x64`

  DotnetSDKBinaryURL:
    Type: String
    Default: https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/89f0ba2a-5879-417b-ba1d-debbb2bde208/b22a9e9e4d513e4d409d2222315d536b/dotnet-sdk-6.0.200-win-x64.exe
    Description: An S3 URI to a exe file containing a .NET SDK

  WebsiteName:
    Type: String
    Default: 'windows-webapp'
    Description: The website name. This is used for local folder paths on the image, and is used for the Windows Service.
