Parameters:
  CustomSubnetId:
    Type: String
    Default: ""
    Description: If you do not have a default VPC, or want to use a different VPC, specify the ID of a subnet in which to place the instance used to customize your EC2 AMI. If not specified, a subnet from your default VPC will be used.
  CustomSecurityGroupId:
    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Default: ""
    Description: Required if you specified a custom subnet ID. Comma-delimted list of one or more IDs of security groups belonging to the VPC to associate with the instance used to customize your EC2 AMI.
  BuildInstanceType:
    Type: CommaDelimitedList
    Default: "t2.micro"
    Description: Comma-delimited list of one or more instance types to select from when building the image. Image Builder will select a type based on availability. The supplied default is compatible with the AWS Free Tier.

Conditions:
  UseCustomSubnetId: !Not [ !Equals [ !Ref CustomSubnetId, "" ] ]
